# Impact-of-GHG-emissions-on-Electric-Grid
There have been several studies on the impact of impact of Grid Purchase, GHG Emissions, Largest Property Use and other energy data to predict Energy Score for building sites but we are looking at the problem from another perspective: We are looking into the data to see if the energy attributes can give us some insight whether the Grid and Total GHG Emissions have some impact on Site Use. This is unique in the sense all the studies either focus on predicting Energy Score or even Smart Grids, but we are looking at the root of the problem. How Gris Purchase and GHG Emissions are highly impactive on the Site Energy Use. Here we are also studying the various effects of other attributes like Electricity Intensity and Gas Intensity to see how, in the absence of Grid Purchase and Total GHG Emissions , the Site Use is impacted.
